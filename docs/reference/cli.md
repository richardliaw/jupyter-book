# The command-line interface

Jupyter Book comes with a command-line interface that makes it easy to
build your books and run a few common functions. This page contains information
about what you can do with the CLI.

This page is a complete reference for the CLI. For newcomers who would like to
get started with the Jupyter Book CLI, we recommend starting with [](../start/overview.md)

:::{note}

You may also use a short-hand for ``jupyter-book`` in the command-line
interface: ``jb``.
For example: `jupyter-book build mybook/` is equivalent to ``jb build mybook/``.
